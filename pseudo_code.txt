1. Input: list of sentences, example: "s1": [a,b,c,f], "s2": [d,c,a,g,h], "s3": [b,a,e,i,k,d], "s4": [],

2. Get set of words and there number of occurences:

Example:
a: 3
b: 2
c: 2
d: 2
e: 1
f: 1
g: 1
h: 1
i: 1
k: 1


3. Put words in database

4. Get sentence that cointains most frequently used word (in this case: a)

With the fewest words: In this case: "s1": [a,b,c,f]

5.  Put (s1)-[:TEACHES]->("a") in db, Put (s1)-[:CONTAINS]->() for b,c,f, Put (s1)-[:AT_INTERVAL]->(interval1), create 1 word phrases for b,c,f, put at interval 1 as well, put (s1)-[:DEPENDS_ON]-> for those 3

Pop words from frequencty dict

6. Get sentence that cointains most frequently used word that doesn't have a sentence at current interval (in this case: d)


With the fewest words: In this case: "s2": [d,c,a,g,h]

7.  Put (s2)-[:TEACHES]->("d") in db, Put (s2)-[:CONTAINS]->() for c,a,g,h Put (s2)-[:AT_INTERVAL]->(interval1), create 1 word phrases for g,h put at interval 1 as well, put (s1)-[:DEPENDS_ON]-> for those 2

8. Get sentence that cointains most frequently used word that doesn't have a sentence at current interval (in this case: Could be e,i,k, Let's pick e)

With the fewest words: In this case: "s3": [b,a,e,i,k,d]


8.  Put (s3)-[:TEACHES]->("e") in db, Put (s3)-[:CONTAINS]->() for b,a,i,k,d Put (s3)-[:AT_INTERVAL]->(interval1), create 1 word phrases for i,k put at interval 1 as well, put (s1)-[:DEPENDS_ON]-> for those 2


Pop words from frequencty dict


9. No words in dict

find remaining sentence that teaches most frequent word and start process over again at interval 2
