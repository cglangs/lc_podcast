Idea #1
Can create a sentence at an interval if a sentence for the same word at the previous interval exists

Can use any word for a which a first interval sentence exists (or a base word)


when querying the words:

must wait for source word to have answered the first interval correctly in order to show the destination sentence 


at the second interval and higher must use at least one additional word from the podcast that is not a base word


(when searching words order by have the fewest sentence in which they are found)

can't use a 2+ interval of a word if that a sentence containing that word at the previous interval as not been used



must use every word atleast once as and additional word; authoring app should have a list of word that have not been used yet.


Time intervals and episode intervals

if the episode interval is reached that word must be reviewed after all the new words have been learned


In author app


1. make user choose next word to teach (drop down order by lowest interval ascending then make add word button appear

2. make user choose words to include (with backspace) make sure to only include words that they have the right to use (order by least recently used (in episodes)) (also include filter for words taught in this episode)

3. if the user is at second interval or higher show message that they must include a word in the episode that has not yet been contained in the interval(if there are some that remain), make message dissapear when they have done it

4. Before being able to write second interval sentence for a word, it must be contained in a sentence teaching another word at .

4. Have a store of sentences actually used in podcast, when all the necessary words have been introduced suggest the sentence to the user.



Rules Clearly:

Start with base words of hsk1-hsk3


Interval 1:

Each sentence:
Can Teach: any word
Must Teach: 1 word
Can Contain: only word being taught (besides base words)

Sum of sentences:
Must teach: every word


Interval 2+:

Each sentence:

Can Teach: any word
Can Contain: word that has been taught as previous interval
Must Contain: word besides word being taught that has not yet been contained at this interval


Sum of sentences:
Must teach: every word
Must constain: every word



ALSO

words have a numerical value 
(
5 for new words that have not been used at this interval
4 for new words in this episode that have already been used at this interval
3 for new words introduced in previous episodes
2 for base words introduced in this episode
1 for base words introduced in a previous episode
)

interval 1: 0-2

interval 2: 2-4

interval 3: 4-6

interval 4: 8-10


etc

for place holders we can just use 1,2,3 etc


MATCH(i:TimeInterval)<-[r:AUTHORING_INTERVAL]-(a:Author)
DELETE r
RETURN i,a

MATCH(i:TimeInterval {interval_order: 1}),(a:Author)
MERGE(a)-[:AUTHORING_INTERVAL]->(i) 
RETURN i,a
