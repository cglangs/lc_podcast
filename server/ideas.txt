Idea #1
Can create a sentence at an interval if a sentence for the same word at the previous interval exists

Can use any word for a which a third interval sentence exists (or a base word)


when querying the words:

must wait for source word to have answered the third interval correctly in order to show the destination sentence 


at the fourth interval and higher must use at least one additional word from the podcast that is not a base word


(when searching words order by have the fewest sentence in which they are found)
